#### Be advised

- **Do not** modify the `.eslintrc.yml` file. It contains all the lint rules for this project
- **Do not** modify the `.gitignore` file.

### Running the project

1.  Clone the repository

    You can run the command `git clone <repo-url>` if you are using the terminal

1.  Install the dependencies

    That's an optional step, but you should do that in order to generate the docs and run the http-server for example

    In your terminal, type the command. You must have `node.js` installed on your machine

    `node install`

1)  Start a web-server

    If you've installed the dependencies, in your terminal, type the command

    `http-server`

### Modifying the Project

To send a pull request to the repo, start by `forking` the project. Then, clone your own fork.

In your machine, you need to add the **main project address** to be able to pull changes from the original project. If you are in the terminal, type the command

`git remote add <main-repo-name> <repo-url>`

Every time that you need to sync your fork with the main project, execute the commands

`git pull <main-repo-name> <main-repo-develop>`

At this moment, we are using the `develop` branch to get and set changes

Later, to send the changes to your fork, you can execute the command

`git push`

It's not necessary put the repo's name and branch because that's all set!

#### New changes

Every time you make changes and need to send a pull request, go through these steps:

- Pull from **main repo**
- Fix possible conflicts
- Push to your fork
- Call for a pull request
